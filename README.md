Spedn
=================================

![logo](https://github.com/sriharikapu/Spedn/blob/master/images/bch-s.png?raw=true)

Spedn is a high level smart contracts language for Bitcoin Cash.
It is designed for explicity and safety:

* It is statically typed - detects many errors at compile time
* It is explicitly typed - no guessing what the expression is supposed to return
* It is purely-functional - free of side effects, the common source of bugs
* It has a familiar C-like syntax
